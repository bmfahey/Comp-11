# Tufts Comp 11 - Intro to CS

In this class I learned the fundamentals of Computer Science.
The class was taught in C++. After the basics (loops, conditionals,
variables, I/O, etc.) the class moved into slightly more in-depth
topics like functions. I learned how to create classes. Dynamic
arrays were covered as well as Linked Lists. The big three 
projects in the class were single-player Snake (which reinforced 
the concept of structs), multi-player Snake (which taught classes),
and a language-determination program that would read in files of 
known languages and use them to determine a "best guess" for the
language of an unknown file. This last project taught how multiple 
classes could interact with each other.
